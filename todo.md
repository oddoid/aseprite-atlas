- Can a JSON format be supported? This would allow the parse step to happen at
  compilation instead of run time.
  - How should infinite be represented?
- Add a more thorough demo. For example, a very small game showcasing a few
  things: different collisioning (including Aseprite GUI screenshots of slices),
  tiling, different animations, parsing and image loading, a mini sprite
  / entity system.
